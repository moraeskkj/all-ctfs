### all-ctfs-i-made

Well, here are all (or almost all) CTF rooms that I found interesting to create since I started studying cybersecurity. Some challenges don't have a readme.txt or any explanation because I probably made them a long time ago, but most do ;)

Probably every readme will include passwords, flags, spoilers, and things like that because I just use it to document what I'm learning. If you only want an explanation without spoilers or anything like that, this isn't for you.

Forgive me for the bad explanations and my English; I'm trying to improve :)

If you need any help, my Instagram is pinned to my profile :)
