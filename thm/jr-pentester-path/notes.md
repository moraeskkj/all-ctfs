### Notes bout jr pentester path

Roles in cyber security can look almost the same but they have little differences.
ROE(Rules of engagement) is a form document that will define the permission,test scope and rules of a penetration test.


## Methodologies
General theme of methodologies 

1. Information Gathering.

2. Enumeration.

3. Exploitation.

4. Privilege Escalation.

5. Post Exploitation.
- you already exploited the enterprise or whatever it be, but in this stage you will searching for more things that you can compromise or some additional data you can get.
- after all you need to report all and etc.

# OSSTMM 
OSSTMM(The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)

This methodology covered more about wired connections, wireless communication and telecommunications.

Some features about this methodology is:
- covers a lot of testing strategies.
- can be very detailed,a little difficult to understand and tend to be quite unique.
- as i said before, tend to focuses more in specific targets such Telecommunications, Wired connections and Wireless connections.

"To start making an OSSTMM test you will need to track what you test (the targets), how you test them (the
parts of the targets tested and not the tools or techniques used), the types of controls discovered, and
what you did not test (targets and parts of the targets). "

# OWASP 
The Open Web Application Security Project methodology.

that methodology covers the top 10 reported vulnerabilities in web applications and servers

some features about this methodology is:
- easy to understand.
- frequently updated.
- covers all states of engagements.
- web applications and web services.

# NIST 
The NIST Cyber Security Framework

is a very popular framework used improve organisations cybersecurity standards.

features:
- frequently updated.
- use a lot of other frameworks so its a quite difficult to understand.
- dont cover cloud security which is getting more popular.
- weak auditing policies which makes the life of blue time and response of incidents roles a quite difficult.
- NIST provides accreditation. 

# CAF
Cyber Security Framework

is a new framework with fourteen principles to assess risk of a lot of cyber threats and how to be protect from them.

This framework applies to enterprises that perform "vitally important services and activities" 

## Principles of Security

CIA TRIAD

confidentiality - the protection to data from unauthorized access.
integrity - the data can be altered, hash and certified help with this.
availability - the service needs to be available the most part of time, an ddos attack break the availability pilar.

"The main difference between PIM(Privilege Identity Management) and PAM(Privilege Access Management) is that PIM addresses what access a user is already granted, while PAM addresses how to monitor and control access whenever a user requests access to a resource."

i didn't know was possible to find subdomains searching for SSL/TLS certificates, cool as fuck
