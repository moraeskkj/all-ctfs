# Flag Command challenge - Very Easy 

In this challenge you have a prompt to insert some commands and play a game to scape to a forest, you have four options in each step and if you choose the correct one, you gonna to next step. First i was think that i just needed to find the correct "sequence" to retrieve the flag but i was wrong, when you reach the fourth step, any of chooses that you have are the correct. So i went to developers tools to read js files and see if i could figure out some logic.

This CheckMessage() function checks if the command I've inserted is available on the option in the currentStep or the 'secret' options, then send my command in a post request to '/api/monitor'. That API is responsible to return the flag to me, as you can see above how it checks if the response has 'HTB{' to show to me a congratulations message or something that PlayerWon() function loads.

So in this state i was thinking how can i find out the all command available, doing a check in where the code sets the availableOptions variable i found this:

So what i did was go to 'api/monitor'
